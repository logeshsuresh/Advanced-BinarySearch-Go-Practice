# Subarray Division Problem - CSES - Problem Set

### Problem Description

You are given an array containing n positive integers.
Your task is to divide the array into k subarrays so that the maximum sum in a subarray is as small as possible.

#### Input 

The first input line contains two integers n and k: the size of the array and the number of subarrays in the division.
The next line contains n integers x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n: the contents of the array.


#### Output

Print one integer: the maximum sum in a subarray in the optimal division.

#### Example

    - Input  :
        array = {2, 4, 7, 3, 5} , k = 3
    - Output :
        8
